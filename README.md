## Backend

### Technologies

- Visual Studio 2022
- .NET 6.0
- Entity Framework Core
</br>

### Instalation

Install necessary packages, they can be found in Dependencies -> Packages in project structure
Use Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Manage Nuget Packages for Solution
</br>

### Database

- SQLITE

Provide correct connection string in appsettings.json file, add:

    "ConnectionStrings": {
        "SL-Connection": "Data Source=database.db;"
    }

and adjust Program.cs, providing adequate DbContext options:

    builder.Services.AddDbContext<DatabaseContext>(options => options.UseSqlite(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("SL-Connection")));

In Visual Studio Run Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Package Manager Console and type:
* enable-migartions
* add-migration test_migration
* update-database

You can also use different database provider, adjusting your connection string and builder.Services DbContext options

</br>
#### Entity Framework

DbContext model has a simple structure - four models with relations one-to-many:
* Country
* City
